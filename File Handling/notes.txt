Introduction to File Handling in C:
File handling in C allows you to read data from files, write data to files, and perform various operations on them. 
It's an essential concept for dealing with external data and is often used for tasks like reading configuration files, 
logging data, and database operations.

Topics to Cover:

Opening and Closing Files:

Using fopen(), fclose(), and modes (e.g., "r", "w", "a", "rb", "wb", "ab").
Checking if file operations are successful.
Reading Data from Files:

fscanf(): Reading formatted data from a file.
fgets(): Reading a line from a file.
getc() and fgetc(): Reading characters from a file.
Handling end-of-file (EOF) and error conditions.
Writing Data to Files:

fprintf(): Writing formatted data to a file.
fputs(): Writing a string to a file.
putc() and fputc(): Writing characters to a file.
Binary File Handling:

Reading and writing binary data using fread() and fwrite().
Advantages and considerations when dealing with binary files.
File Positioning:

ftell(): Getting the current position in a file.
fseek() and rewind(): Changing the file position.
Error Handling:

Using feof() and ferror() to detect end-of-file and error conditions.
Working with CSV Files:

Reading and parsing CSV files.
Writing data to a CSV file.
File Manipulation:

Renaming and deleting files using rename() and remove().
File I/O Examples:

Examples of reading and writing data to/from files.
Implementing simple applications that use file handling.
Best Practices and Tips:

Properly closing files after use.
Handling errors gracefully.
Good coding practices for file handling.












Topic 1: Opening and Closing Files
Opening and closing files is the first step in file handling. It allows us to interact with files on the disk.

Example: Reading a File
Suppose we have a file named "data.txt" that contains some numbers, each on a separate line. We want to read these numbers and calculate their sum.
